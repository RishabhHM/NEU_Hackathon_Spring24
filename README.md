# Northeastern University | Data Mining Hackathon | Spring'24

## FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (NIBRS)
<hr>

## Background
Northeastern University hosted a data mining hackathon in the spring of 2024, inviting participants to engage in tasks centered around data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling. All participants were provided with the same dataset, emphasizing fairness and uniformity in approach. This event aimed to foster innovation and skill development in data mining methodologies, encouraging participants to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world datasets.


## Objective
The objective of the hackathon was two-fold:
1. Perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the given dataset, using suitable visualizations to understand insights related to the assigned tasks.

2. Building statistical models to predict the total number of offenses based on the dataset attributes.

The ultimate goal was to develop reliable and precise models capable of forecasting crime rates efficiently, while also emphasizing the explanation of performance and interpretability of the selected modeling methods. The objectives helped showcase expertise in both data preprocessing and predictive modeling, addressing real-world data mining challenges effectively.

## Data Sources
This project examines the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data from 2012, obtained from law enforcement agencies that provided a full year of NIBRS data to the FBI UCR Program. The data was processed and released in the Crime in the United States (CIUS) report for the year 2012. The dataset was already acquired by the organizers and provided to all participants as part of the hackathon.
